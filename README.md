Specification of the App 
The App is an Activity-logging app that tracks daily activity of the user and records this for subsequent review and fitness progress monitoring. 
The app will record the user’s daily activities allowing them to build an activity profile over time. The app will enable the user to view their activity behavior and to evaluate their achievement in various ways.
Typically the user will run the app and start a ‘session’. They can then forget about it, and later in the day, they can revisit it and review their day’s activity.
There are many ways in which this task can be approached and many design decisions to make.

The platform chosen to make this app is an android mobile device which will be explored more in the platform selection section. The Time to complete this app is estimated at 6 weeks. 

Design & Implementation 

User Interface

To navigate through the UI there first needed to be multiple activities created to get to screen to screen. On the XML design sheet each activity had its own buttons which are meant to navigate and perform actions. The challenges faced with the UI were the connecting of different activities by using buttons and having appropriate breadcrumbs within the activities to navigate back out again. 

Maps Integration and GPS 
Using the help of the Google play services Map were able to be integrated with multiple features which benefited the overall app. The GPS location tool within the activity was able to point exactly to where the user on the map which helps the activity logging session. 

Timer Integration
The challenges faced with implementing the timer were to get the format correct into the time view as shown below and for it to increment every second. This was managed by including a chronometer underneath the buttons and once the button start is clicked it will count one every second. It will stop when stop is clicked.  

Determination of Energy 
The fitness app will be using lots of energy and power from the device and how battery use would be helpful but I have destroyed activities that are not in use to help this effect.

Testing 
I tested my app by using a trace file within each of the activities to test for any bugs or lag on the project. The results were clean and the app is running smoothly. 

Publication 
I am publishing the app on Samsung apps.com as it is free and provides a platform for the app. Setup is shown below:
 
Conclusion 
From creating this I will now always know and remember how to begin most of the tedious tasks to begin the app development such as connecting a device to debug on and downloading the correct software.  I have further developed my skills with java. I have knowledge on how to test my app and publish it for free. Android studio is now my main IDE to develop app as I found it very user friendly and useful.
